# Test Driven Development (TDD) 

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing code. In this process, developers write automated tests to specify the desired behavior of a system, and then write the code necessary to pass those tests. This approach has gained popularity over the years due to its many benefits, including increased code quality, faster feedback loops, and reduced time spent on debugging.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in Test Driven Development:


1. **Write a failing test (<span style="color:red">*RED*</span>):** In TDD, the first step is to write a test that defines the behavior you want to see in your system. This test should initially fail because there is no code in place to satisfy it.

1. **Make the test pass (<span style="color:green">*GREEN*</span>):** After writing the test, the developer writes the minimum amount of code necessary to pass the test. This code should be as simple and straightforward as possible, with no unnecessary complexity. Use design principle *Keep It Simple, Stupid(KISS)* that suggests that systems should be designed in the simplest way possible.   

1. **Refactor the code (<span style="color:blue">BLUE</span>):** Once the test has passed, the developer refactors the code to make it more efficient, maintainable, and scalable. This ensures that the code remains clean and easy to understand as it evolves over time. Use some of design techniques such as `Don't Repeat Yourselves (DRY)` or `Duplicate Is Evil (DIE)`, try to reduce `Time Complexity`

1. **Repeat the process:** The developer repeats this process by writing another failing test, writing the code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code. This iterative cycle helps to ensure that the code is continuously improving and meeting the desired requirements.

let's deep dive into each of TDD cycle
### **Write a failing test (<span style="color:red">*Red*</span>)**
Writing a failing test is an important step in the Test Driven Development (TDD) process. The goal of writing a failing test is to define the behavior you want to see in your system, and ensure that the code you write later will fulfill that behavior.

Here are some best practices for writing failing tests in TDD:

* Define the behavior: Before writing a test, it's important to define the behavior you want to see in your system. Be as specific as possible about the expected outcome of the test.

* Write a test that fails: Write a test that will fail because there is no code in place to satisfy it. The test should be simple and specific, testing only one behavior at a time.

* Keep it short: Failing tests should be short and focused. This will make it easier to identify the cause of the failure and fix it quickly.

* Don't rely on implementation details: Tests should not rely on implementation details, but rather on the behavior of the system. This will make the tests more resilient to changes in the code.

* Write negative tests: In addition to writing positive tests that check for correct behavior, it's also important to write negative tests that check for incorrect behavior. This will help catch edge cases and ensure that the system is robust.

* Run the test: After writing the test, run it to ensure that it fails. This will confirm that the test is written correctly and will pass once the code is implemented.

### **Make the test pass (<span style="color:green">*Green*</span>)**

Making the test pass is a critical step in the Test Driven Development (TDD) process. The goal of this step is to write code that satisfies the behavior defined in the test. 

Here are some best practices for making tests pass in TDD:

* Write the minimum code required to make the test pass: The code written to pass the test should be minimal, only implementing the behavior needed to pass the test. This helps avoid over-engineering and keeps the code simple.

* Refactor the code: Once the test passes, refactor the code to improve its design and eliminate any duplication or other issues. Refactoring should be done in small steps, ensuring that the code remains functional at all times.

* Run all tests: After making the test pass and refactoring the code, run all tests to ensure that the changes have not broken any existing functionality.

* Keep the code clean: It's important to write clean, readable code that follows best practices. This includes using meaningful variable and method names, commenting where necessary, and following coding standards.

* Focus on one test at a time: TDD involves writing tests one at a time, and then making them pass. It's important to stay focused on one test at a time, and not move on to the next until the current test is passing.

* Don't skip tests: Skipping tests can lead to incomplete or unreliable code. It's important to write and pass all tests, even if they seem trivial or redundant.

### **Refactor (<span style="color:blue">*Blue*</span>)**
Refactoring is an important process in software development, which involves improving the design of existing code without changing its functionality. The goal of refactoring is to make code more maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

Here are some design techniques that can be used during the refactoring process:

* Extract Methods: Extracting methods from large, complex methods can improve the readability and maintainability of the code. It also makes the code more modular, allowing for easier testing and reuse.

* Rename Variables and Methods: Renaming variables and methods to more descriptive names can improve the readability of the code, making it easier for other developers to understand.

* Replace Magic Numbers with Constants: Magic numbers are hard-coded values in the code that have no explanation. Replacing these values with constants can make the code more understandable and maintainable.

* Simplify Conditionals: Complex conditional statements can be hard to understand and debug. Simplifying them by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces can make the code more readable and maintainable.

* Remove Duplicate Code: Duplication is a common source of errors and can make code difficult to maintain. Removing duplicate code and creating reusable functions or classes can improve the overall quality of the code.

* Use Design Patterns: Design patterns are commonly used solutions to recurring design problems. Using them during the refactoring process can improve the structure of the code and make it easier to maintain.

* Break Large Classes into Smaller Ones: Large classes can be difficult to understand and maintain. Breaking them down into smaller, more focused classes can make the code more modular and easier to manage.

## Why TDD
So, why use TDD? Here are some benefits:

1. Improved code quality: By writing tests first, developers can ensure that their code is working correctly from the start. This can help catch issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of bugs and making the code more robust.

1. Faster feedback loops: With TDD, feedback is received almost immediately after writing code. This allows developers to identify issues quickly and fix them before they become bigger problems.

1. Increased productivity: TDD can help developers become more productive by reducing the amount of time spent on debugging and testing.

1. Better collaboration: TDD can promote better collaboration between team members by providing a shared understanding of the desired behavior of the system. 

1. Easier maintenance: With TDD, code is broken down into small, testable units, making it easier to maintain and modify as the system evolves over time.

## Conclusion 

Test Driven Development is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests first. It can help improve code quality, reduce the risk of bugs, and increase productivity. By following a TDD approach, developers can create software that is more reliable, maintainable, and scalable.
